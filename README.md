# Map Container in c++
# --------------------
# Compiling
Please use the Makefile command 'make' to compile my code (this will also compile all of the professors test code)<br />
Personal testing is done in main.cpp.
# --------------------
# Running
Use the Makefile command 'make run-with-valgrind' to automatically run all tests (including my personal test) with valgrind (results slower execution)<br />
Use the Makefile command 'make run' to automatically run all tests (including my personal test) without valgrind
# --------------------
# Memory
There are no memory leaks or errors in my program, you can test this with 'make run-with-valgrind.'
# --------------------
# Note: I was given an extension until tuesday night (4/9/19 11:59 PM)
Also I just noticed that I accidently started this project with my personal github account (Guambo)<br />
Please ignore this
