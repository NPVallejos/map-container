# Map Container in c++
This project was assigned for my advanced object oriented programming class, so I ommitted the professors test cases to respect his privacy. <br/>
The objective of the assignment was to recreate the std::map class, so it was helpful to look at the specifications for this class on cplusplus.com (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/). <br/>
The main takeaway that I got from this project was learning how to program using templates (plus I got a deeper understanding of how std::map actually works).
# Compiling
Please use the Makefile command 'make' to compile my code (this will also compile all of the professors test code)<br />
Personal testing is done in main.cpp.
# Running
Use the Makefile command 'make run-with-valgrind' to automatically run all tests (including my personal test) with valgrind (results slower execution)<br />
Use the Makefile command 'make run' to automatically run all tests (including my personal test) without valgrind
# Memory
There are no memory leaks or errors in my program, you can test this with 'make run-with-valgrind.'
